# Image Caption Generator

This is a Python script that uses a pre-trained image captioning model to generate captions for images. It utilizes the Hugging Face `transformers` library for the vision encoder-decoder model and the `ViTFeatureExtractor` for image feature extraction. The generated captions are decoded using the `gpt2` tokenizer.
